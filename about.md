I’m a Spanish full-stack developer living in Sydney, Australia, with special
interest in frontend development and management systems (e.g. e-commerce, finance).

I work at Zanui developing the most awesome e-commerce experience in Australia.

Before, I worked at JIG developing web applications in PHP and Javascript, and
at Ingeniería e Innovación providing companies with advanced support on the
management of their innovation and R&D processes.
